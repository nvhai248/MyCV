# ABOUT ME

Throughout my studies and work, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in programming languages such as javascript and Golang, as well as in software development methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall. I am a quick learner and have a keen eye for detail, which helps me identify and solve problems efficiently. I am also a team player and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals. In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and work on personal coding projects to further enhance my skills. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and am eager to learn and grow in a dynamic and innovative work environment.
